## Restaurant Densities in Bangalore

### Background

<font size="4"><div style="text-align: justify"><p> Bangalore is the capital of the Indian state of Karnataka with a population of over <b>10 million</b> (density of over <b>4000 per sq. km</b>), making it the third most populous city in India.</p>
  
<div style="text-align: justify"><p>As a result of the high population density, owners of shops end up sharing places. From the point of view of investors, they would prefer to set up businesses in neighborhoods where the competition is less intense.
  
<div style="text-align: justify"><p>For both residents and travelers, exploring various neighborhoods and venues is a good way to relax during weekends and holidays. The diversity of the cuisine available is reflective of the social and economic diversity of Bangalore. Bangalore has a wide and varied mix of restaurant types and cuisines and Bangaloreans deem eating out as an intrinsic part of their culture. Roadside vendors, South Indian, North Indian, Chinese and Western fast food are all very popular in the city.</p></div>

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>Considering the above points, creating a map of Bangalore with districts grouped together with the help of clustering according to the venue, specifically restaurant density would be helpful.</p>
