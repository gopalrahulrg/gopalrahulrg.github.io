## Feedback on JavaPresse Coffee Grinder

<font size="5"><h3>Background</h3></font>

<font size="4"><div style="text-align: justify"><p> JavaPresse produces and sells possibly the most popular manual coffee grinder in the world which is available for purchase on various Ec-commerce stores including the company's website and Amazon.</p>
  
<div style="text-align: justify"><p>The majority of the cutomers that have purchased the product seem to have been satisfied with unsatisfactory feedback seeming to be relatively low.</p></div>

<font size="5"><h3>Data Description</h3></font>

<font size="4"><p>Data was acquired from Amazon using web scraping which includes</p>

<ul>
  <li>5000 descriptive reviews left by various customers;</li>
  <li>The corresponding star rating on a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being the lowest).</li>
</ul>

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>The dataset used for the project is available on Kaggle and can be accessed using <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/gopalrahulrg/amazon-reviews-javapresse-coffee-grinder">this</a> link.</p>

<font size="5"><h3>Methodology</h3></font>

<p></p>

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>The master data contains reviews that are divided into five different classes and a preview is shown below.</p>

<p></p>

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cjcr/cjcr_1.jpg">
  
<p></p>

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>Visualization of the class distributions after reccategorization into two different classes, namely positive/non critical (denoted as 1 in the chart) and negative/critical (denoted as 0 in the chart) shows that the latter are in the minority as mentioned earlier.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cjcr/cjcr_2.jpg">
  
<p></p>

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>The text data was cleaned using a variety of techniques including removal of special characters and stopwords through tokenization.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>Various machine learning algorithms including a simple feedforward neural network were selected to build a classification model through undersampling and assigning class weights using tf-idf (and word embeddings for the latter)  to evaluate their performances on the available data.</p> 

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>Since the data is highly imblanced, conventional evaluation techniques like accuracy weren't deemed suitable to evaluate model performance; Recall, Precision & F1 metrics for the minority class were used instead by defining custom scorers.</p> 
  
<font size="5"><h3>Results</h3></font>

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>The neural network model was overfitting (most likely due to lack of sufficient training data as shown below) and was outperformed by logistic regression and support vector classifiers.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cjcr/cjcr_3.jpg">
  
<p></p>

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>Although it was able to produce recall scores of up to 85 %, precision for various model using Undersampling was lower than 50 % for the target class. Comparatively, using class weights (with both tf-idf and word embeddings) resulted in over 80 % recall, 50 % precision and higher F1-Scores.</p>

<p></p>

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>Finally, a grid search was performed for hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance (whilst modeling with class weights); the corresponding confusion matrices are shown below.</p>

<p></p>

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>Grid Search using cross validation seems to have improved F1-Scores for the target class.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cjcr/cjcr_6.jpg">
  
<p></p>

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>A copy of the working notebook is available <a href="https://github.com/gopalrahulrg/gopalrahulrg.github.io/blob/master/assets/books/cjcr/rg_cjcr_11_04_2020.ipynb">here</a> and a short video presentation is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1P0jN5v00w">here</a>.</p>

<font size="5"><h3>Conclusion</h3></font>

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>Logistic Regression and Support Vector classifiers with tf-idf provide over 50 % precision and 80 % recall relatively quickly.</p>
  
<div style="text-align: justify"><p>Word Embeddings can be used to improve the accuracy of the model with the help of LSTM/GRU but additional data will be required to implement them effectively.</p>
